Two cans are with capacity X and Y liters.
The program must determine the number of steps required to obtain exactly Z litres of liquid in one of the cans. 
At the beginning both cans are empty.
The following operations are counted as "steps". 
        - emptying a vessel, 
        - filling a vessel, 
        - pouring liquid from one can to the other, without spilling, until one of the cans is either full or empty.
If it is not possible to obtain Z liters exactly then the output must be -1. 
Boundary Conditions: 0 < X <= 100 0 < Y <= 100 0 < Z <= 100
Input Format: First line will contain the value of X 
              Second line will contain the value of Y
              Third line will contain the value of Z 
Output Format: The number of steps required as an integer.
               If it is not possible to obtain Z liters then the output is -1. 
Sample Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input: 5 2 3
Output: 2 
Explanation: Here X=5, Y=2 
            Step 1: Pour 5 liters of liquid into 5 liter can 
            Step 2: Pour 2 liters from 5 liter can into 2 liter can. Now the 5 liter can will have 3 liters which is Z. 
            Hence 2 steps are required.
Example 2:
Input: 2 3 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Z is greater than X and Y.
Hence it is not possible to have 4 liters in any one of the cans. 
Hence output is -1. 


#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{  int x,y,z,steps=0,s1,s2;
   scanf("%d %d %d",&x,&y,&z);
   x>y?(s1=x,s2=y):(s1=y,s2=x);
  if(z<s1){
       while(s1>s2){
           s1=s1-s2;
           steps=steps+2;
           if(s1==z)
             break;
       }
   }
   if(s1==z)
     printf("%d",steps);
   else
     printf("-1");
